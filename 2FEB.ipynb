    "1. Tuples are a data structure in Python that represent a collection of ordered, heterogeneous elements. The following are the main characteristics of tuples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordered: The elements in a tuple have a defined order, and this order is maintained when the tuple is iterated over.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heterogeneous: Tuples can contain elements of different data types, including other tuples, in the same collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable: Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed or modified. This makes tuples useful for representing data that should not change, such as dates, coordinates, or fixed sets of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supports indexing and slicing: Tuples support both indexing and slicing, allowing you to access specific elements or ranges of elements within the tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can be used as keys in dictionaries: Since tuples are immutable, they can be used as keys in dictionaries, while lists cannot be used as keys because they are mutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, tuples are indeed immutable, meaning that their elements cannot be changed once the tuple is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Tuples have two built-in methods in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "count(): This method returns the number of times a specific value appears in the tuple.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "t = (1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2)\n",
    "print(t.count(2))\n",
    "# Output: 3\n",
    "\n",
    "index(): This method returns the index of the first occurrence of a specific value in the tuple.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "t = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "print(t.index(3))\n",
    "# Output: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples have fewer built-in methods than lists because they are meant to be simple, lightweight data structures that represent a fixed collection of elements. Lists, on the other hand, are more flexible and are meant to support a wider range of operations, such as adding and removing elements. As a result, lists have more built-in methods to support these operations, while tuples have only a limited number of methods that allow you to access and manipulate their elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The collection datatype in Python that does not allow duplicate items is a set.\n"

    "\n",
    "union() method returns a new set that contains all elements from the original set and all elements from the specified set. It does not modify the original set.\n",
